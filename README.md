# smart-traffic-light-with-proximity-sensor

Welcome to the repository for our innovative "Smart Traffic Light with Proximity Sensor" project! This repository hosts the code and resources needed to create an intelligent traffic management system that leverages cutting-edge technology to enhance road safety and optimize traffic flow.

#ðŸš¦ Project Overview:
Our project aims to revolutionize traditional traffic light systems by incorporating a proximity sensor-based approach. By integrating advanced proximity sensing technology, we have developed a traffic light system that can intelligently detect the presence of vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists at intersections. This real-time data enables the traffic lights to dynamically adjust their timing, minimizing congestion and enhancing the safety of all road users.

#ðŸŒŸ Key Features:

Proximity Sensing: We have implemented a robust proximity sensor system that accurately detects the presence and movement of vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists in the vicinity of the traffic light.

Dynamic Timing: The traffic lights utilize the data from the proximity sensors to adaptively adjust their signal timings. This ensures efficient traffic flow by giving priority to areas with higher vehicular and pedestrian density.

Safety Enhancement: With real-time awareness of the road environment, our smart traffic light system enhances safety by preventing accidents and minimizing conflicts between different road users.
